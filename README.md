# KNN-Classifier-in-2D-Euclidean-Distance-Implementation
This repository contains a Python implementation of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier for 2D data points using the Euclidean distance metric. The classifier determines the class of query points based on the nearest neighbors from a provided dataset.
